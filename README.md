# learn-solidity

The nft branch contains a Solidity smart contract implementing a simple NFT collection.

The used approach was taken from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXLAFpOS_kQ
and this repo: https://github.com/davidrazmadzeExtra/ERC721_NFT

There are some difference with the origin author
because the initial implementation provided by open zeppelin:
https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/wizard
differs from that one from the video.

The contract was deployed to the Sepolia test net:
